# Word of Wisdom TCP Server and Client

This project demonstrates a simple TCP server that provides a "word of wisdom" quote to a client after successfully completing a Proof of Work (PoW) challenge. The setup utilizes Docker to containerize both the server and client applications and employs a Makefile to streamline the processes of building, running, and managing Docker containers and networks.
